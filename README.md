# Proposal_11-13
This is the home of the proposal for the final project.
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of pong where the score refrences significant numbers in pop culture.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I thought of doing this because I've started playing curb ball with my roomates and whenever we get the score to 9-5 we say "Dolly" for Dolly Parton's song "9 to 5." So that was something I wanted to create in pong. When the game gets to a certain score, like 9 to 5 for example, there will be a little message on the screen refrenceing this number in a pop culture setting. Another example of this would be the famaous number of 69. So when the score becomes 6-9 then there will be a message that pops up saying "nice." If I have the time or ability, I was thinking of having animations for when the messages popup on the screen to make it a little more exciting.

By using Love and the CS50x lesson, we can either use if statements to call for a string when the game reaches the certain score. Or we might be able to use a list and call for an index at the score. (I am honestly open to ideas into how to implement this if you do have any suggestions. I still feel a little confused on some topics since this is my first time ever learning code so I don't want to go to complex)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to get at least 10 different pop culture refrences in to the game of pong.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to get a dozen or 15 pop culture refrences into the game and maybe some animations of the refrence on the screen.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be getting a pop culture refrence for each score and an animation for each too.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is decide on exactly how I want to go about executing it by looking at the capabilities of Love and what we have learned in class. This will include utilizing resources online like youtube and github, and some personal help from TA's. There will definitely be some new skills that I will need to develop in order to transition more to Love from Python and implementing these animations. I will have the right idea of what exactly I will need to do more research on and what skills to develop when I have the best way to implement the code.
